# StoryForge AI

> **IBM AI Builders Challenge — July 2026 · Creative Industries theme**

**One sentence becomes a complete story pitch deck — outline, characters, world-building, concept art, audio narration, and a downloadable PDF — powered by IBM Granite.**

---

## The Problem

Creators — writers, indie game designers, tabletop RPG builders, filmmakers — have sparks of ideas constantly. Turning a concept into a shareable, presentable pitch takes hours: writing a premise, inventing characters, designing the world, sourcing placeholder art, and formatting it all into something you can hand to a collaborator.

Existing AI tools solve these pieces in isolation across different tabs. Nobody stitches them into one coherent, downloadable creative document automatically.

---

## The Solution

StoryForge AI takes a single line of user input — e.g. *"A blind cartographer discovers the world is flat"* — and generates a complete, publication-quality **Story Pitch Deck** in under 60 seconds:

| Output | What's generated |
|---|---|
| **Story outline** | Title, logline, premise, three-act structure, theme, tone |
| **3 Character profiles** | Name, role, physical description, backstory, motivation, fatal flaw, defining quote |
| **World building** | Setting name, geography, rules/magic/tech system, cultural flavour, atmosphere |
| **4 Concept art images** | FLUX-generated, described by Granite from the actual story content |
| **Audio narration** | ElevenLabs TTS for each of the 3 acts — voice tuned per genre |
| **PDF export** | Styled A4 pitch deck with all content and images, one-click download |

Everything stays **coherent** — character names, the world name, visual art prompts, and narration all reference the same story, because every step of the AI chain receives the previous outputs as context.

### Why Sequential Chain (not LangGraph)

A sequential chain — prompt 1 → output 1 → prompt 2 that includes output 1 as context — achieves the same coherence as a multi-agent pipeline for this use case. LangGraph adds graph state management and tool registration complexity that buys nothing extra for a solo-built creative generation flow. Simplicity is a feature: the architecture is readable in five minutes and the demo is reliable.

---

## Feature List

### Core
- **Single-prompt generation** — one sentence generates the full deck
- **8 genre presets** — Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Thriller, Horror, Romance, Historical, Mystery, Adventure
- **Story scope selector** — Short Story, Feature Film, TV Pilot, Video Game, Book Series / Epic
- **Advanced options panel** — Tone, Ending type, Target audience, Setting era (all optional)
- **6-step animated progress bar** — shows exactly which AI is running at each moment
- **Progressive reveal** — each section appears as its data arrives; images load one-by-one
- **Dark mode** — full theme toggle in the header
- **Example prompt chips** — 4 clickable concepts on the landing page for instant demo

### Regenerate & Rollback (Beyond original spec)
- **Per-section regenerate** — Story, Characters, and World each have a Regenerate button; Granite re-runs only that step using the current deck as context
- **Per-image regenerate** — hover any of the 4 concept art images → Regenerate icon; Granite rewrites the art prompt for that slot, then FLUX generates a new image
- **Rollback / Keep UX** — every regeneration (text and image) snapshots the previous version; a "Roll back / Keep new" banner lets you undo with one click
- **Manual audio refresh** — after story regeneration, stale audio is cleared; a "Regenerate Audio" button re-runs ElevenLabs narration for the updated acts

### Landing Page
- **DemoDeck** — a static hardcoded sample pitch deck is visible on the landing page so the output quality is immediately apparent without waiting for a generation

### Audio
- **Per-genre voice profiles** — each genre maps to a distinct ElevenLabs voice (e.g. Thriller → Harry, Fantasy → George, Romance → Sarah)
- **Per-act dynamics** — stability and style parameters are tuned per act (setup vs. conflict vs. resolution)
- **Client-side retry** — two sweeps across the 3 acts with 2-second gaps; eliminates silent acts caused by server-side timeout issues

### Export
- **Styled A4 PDF** — dark header band, amber accent lines, character Wants/Flaw two-column layout, all 4 images in a 2×2 grid, per-page footer
- **Filename derived from title** — e.g. `the-edge-of-everything-pitch-deck.pdf`

## How IBM Bob Was Used

IBM Bob was the **primary development tool** for this project — every significant piece of code was built with Bob. This is a requirement of the IBM AI Builders challenge and also genuinely how the app was built.

### What Bob built, session by session

| Phase | What Bob built |
|---|---|
| **Phase 1 — Foundation** | Full Next.js scaffold, `lib/types.ts` (all TypeScript interfaces and constants), `lib/prompts.ts` (all 4 prompt templates with JSON schemas), `lib/granite.ts` (watsonx.ai client, retry logic, JSON parsing), `lib/replicate.ts` (Pollinations FLUX client), `app/api/generate/route.ts` (sequential chain), `app/api/images/route.ts` |
| **Phase 2 — Features** | `app/api/narrate/route.ts` (ElevenLabs TTS with per-genre voice profiles and per-act dynamics), advanced `StoryOptions` type with 6 fields, all advanced prompt engineering (tone/ending/audience/era constraints baked into every Granite call), `lib/pdfExport.ts` (full styled A4 with images) |
| **Phase 2 — UI** | All UI components: `PromptInput.tsx` (genre/scope/advanced panel), `LoadingPipeline.tsx`, `StorySection.tsx`, `CharacterCard.tsx`, `WorldSection.tsx`, `ArtGrid.tsx`, `ExportButton.tsx`, `app/page.tsx` (full wiring, dark mode, error states) |
| **Phase 3 — Bug fixes** | Audio fix (server-side `sleep()` timeout → client-side 2-sweep retry), image display fix (`aspect-square` + `object-cover`), PDF layout fix (theme/tone line overflow), image prompt revert |
| **Phase 3b — Beyond PRD** | `app/api/regenerate/route.ts` (per-section Granite regen endpoint), `singleArtPrompt` template, per-section Regenerate + Rollback/Keep UX across all 3 text sections and all 4 image slots, `DemoDeck.tsx` static component, `AbortController` wiring, parallel audio+image lane architecture |

### How Bob was used in practice

- **One task per concern** — each phase and each major component was a separate Bob task, keeping context tight and outputs focused.
- **Iterative refinement** — Bug fixes were their own sessions. Bob was shown the exact error (e.g. `Act 2 + Act 3 audio silent`) and the root cause was diagnosed and fixed without touching unrelated code.
- **Prompt engineering collaboration** — The `lib/prompts.ts` templates evolved through Bob sessions, with each iteration producing better-structured JSON outputs from Granite.
- **Architecture decisions first** — The sequential chain vs. LangGraph decision, the jsPDF vs. html2canvas decision, and the Pollinations vs. Replicate switch were all reasoned through with Bob before writing a line of code.

## Demo Note

> **The demo video is recorded on `localhost:3000`.** Vercel deployment was skipped to avoid
> environment configuration risk in the final submission window. The app runs fully on local
> dev with the three API keys above. Anyone evaluating the submission can run it locally
> using the setup instructions in this README.

## Challenge Alignment

| Judging Criterion | How StoryForge AI addresses it |
|---|---|
| **Technical Execution** | Sequential LLM prompt chain with structured JSON outputs; parallel audio+image lanes; per-section regeneration with rollback; server-side API routes with proper secret management; type-safe throughout with `tsc --noEmit` passing at 0 errors |
| **Innovation** | Combines structured story generation + coherent world-building + AI concept art + per-act audio narration + one-click styled PDF into a single seamless flow — and adds per-section + per-image regeneration with rollback UX |
| **Challenge Fit** | Directly embodies "AI as a creative partner for creative industries" — Granite maintains creative coherence across five interdependent outputs |
| **Feasibility** | Single repo, three API keys, zero infrastructure — runs locally with `npm run dev` |
| **Real-World Impact** | Writers, game designers, and indie creators spend hours creating pitches manually. This turns that into 60 seconds and produces a shareable, professional document |
